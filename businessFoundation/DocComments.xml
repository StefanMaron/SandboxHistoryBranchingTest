            For some business scenarios it is important that the No. Series does not produce gaps. This procedure is used to verify that does not happen.

            <returns>Whether it is possible that the implementation will produce gaps.</returns>

            <summary>
            Computes a nearness score between strings. Nearness is based on repeatedly finding longest common substrings.
            Substring matches below Threshold are not considered.
            Normalizing factor is the max value returned by this procedure.

            <returns>A number between 0 and NormalizingFactor, representing how much of the strings was matched</returns>
